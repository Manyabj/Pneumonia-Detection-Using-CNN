# Pneumonia Detection Using CNN
Pneumonia is a serious lung infection caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, and it is a significant cause of death, particularly in children under five years old and in the elderly. Chest X-rays are the primary tool used by radiologists to detect pneumonia and identify the affected areas in the lungs.


The main objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to accurately detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. This model aims to assist doctors by providing a quick and reliable diagnosis, enabling timely treatment for patients. By training the CNN on a well-curated dataset of chest X-ray images, the model can learn to distinguish between healthy and infected lungs with high accuracy.
## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://universe.roboflow.com/mohamed-traore-2ekkp/chest-x-rays-qjmia/dataset/4) dataset available on Robo flow. It contains:

- **Training Set**: Images used for training the CNN.
- **Validation Set**: Images used for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Test Set**: Images used to evaluate the model's performance.
